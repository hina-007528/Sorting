# Sorting
<h1>📊 Sorting Algorithms</h1>
The Sorting section in this repository includes various algorithms used to arrange elements in a specific order (typically ascending or descending). Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in searching, data processing, and optimization problems.

<h2>✅ Covered Algorithms:</h2>

<h3>Merge Sort</h3> – Divide and conquer approach with O(n log n) complexity

<h3>Quick Sort</h3> – Fast average-case performance (O(n log n)), but O(n²) worst-case

<h2>🔍 Key Concepts:</h2>
<h3>Time Complexity:</h3> Varies by algorithm, important for performance optimization<br>

<h3>Stability:</h3> Preserves the relative order of equal elements<br>

<h3>In-Place vs. Out-of-Place:</h3> Memory usage considerations<br>

<h3>Comparison-Based vs. Non-Comparison-Based:</h3> Determines sorting strategy
